# User testing a public transport ticket reader #

Client: Cubic

![New York City subway](../img/nycitymetro.png){: .hero}

## Overview ##

New York City’s transport system operates using a system of plastic cards that passengers load with funds and then swipe through ticket barriers. Rolled out in 1993, the transit authority wanted to bring their ticket readers up to date so machines accepted new payment methods such as contactless.

## Challenge ##

Our client Cubic was designing a machine that would recognise and accept more and different payments. These included contactless, digital tickets within a mobile app and machine-printed paper tickets containing QR codes. 

To prevent congestion during peak times, 30 passengers needed to be able to pass through the gates every minute. Prior user testing had found that users took _up to a minute_ to validate their ticket and pass through the barriers. 

Participants didn't understand where the scanning functionality was located within the device and where to best place their ticket. To avoid a re-design of the physical device and possible delay to the  roll-out of the new machines, the client wanted to understand whether changes to the reader display could fix the problem. 

## My role ##

I worked as UX consultant within City’s Interaction Lab, a commercial UX consultancy operating within City’s Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design. I met with the client to learn more about the ticket barriers and understand their expections for the study. I then designed the study, and created all test materials. I managed a student consultant, and together we ran the study. I then reviewed session notes and participant timings, and produced a detailed report for the client.
 
## Approach ##

### Preparation ###

The study involved multiple variables and scenarios: 
{: .list}
* 3 devices &ndash; a bus, new subway validator and an old subway validator
* 3 types of tickets &ndash; 2 paper and 1 mobile app
* 4 display screen variations

A mix of commuter and visitor participants were recruited via an external agency. 

Different scenarios within my script tested each of the validators with different combinations of tickets and displays. I varied task order from session to session to reduce the impact of system learnability and participant bias. We used a spreadsheet to keep the variables straight during testing.

We piloted the study in the client’s office. We noticed we needed a definitive way of measuring time on task, so during testing we marked the lab floor with masking tape. After I gave the participant the first task the student consultant started the timer. Once the participant  passed through the ticket barrier and walked into the taped zone, we stopped the timer.

### Study ###


Within the usability lab we set up the 3 different validators &ndash; bus, subway and existing subway machine. We used 2 cameras to record participants as they used the machines. The ticket validators were initially covered by boxes. This way participants’ initial impressions were captured while the cameras were recording. 

Participants successfully validated their ticket when the screen displayed a static QR code towards the bottom of the device, closest to the scanner. Using this finding, the client was able to test 2 new iterations of the QR-code display on the second day of testing.

### Findings and recommendations ###

After finishing the testing I reviewed the session notes together with the student consultant and agreed on the main findings. 

Of all the different screens tested, participants were more likely to validate their ticket with one displaying a QR-code in the lower half of the device. The placement and range of the scanner meant users needed to hover their ticket a few centimeters above the lower edge of the device. Even with the best performing variation of the display, participants struggled to learn where exactly they needed to position their ticket in order to pass through the barriers. Many couldn’t do this within 2 seconds, especially on their first attempt.

As the changes to the ticket reader display did not have the desired effect, I recommended the following: 
{: .list}

1.	If time permits, update the physical device. Recess and inset the scanner so users can successfully validate their ticket by placing it directly on the screen. The tactile feedback would provide users with certainty and confidence, and would make learning where to place the ticket easy. 
2.	If time doesn’t allow,change the display so users are more likely to position their ticket within the scanner’s range. Possible changes to consider and test include:
   * Dividing the contactless and barcode sections of the screen with different background colours to prevent users from placing mobile and paper tickets directly on the display. 
   * Updating the static image to an animation that shows a hand holding a QR code ticket in the correct position in front of the device. 
   * Adding decals and labels to the device housing to direct users towards the scanner.
   
My written report provided additional detailed findings and recommendations for the ticket barrier &ndash; its height, lights, and sounds; the device housing; the display; and planned turnstiles. While there weren’t enough participants to produce statistically representative results, I also provided time on task by participant and task success rates.

## Outcome ##
The New York Transit Authority started rolling out the first phase of new ticket readers in 2019. To start these have been limited to contactless, Apple Pay and Google Pay. Further payment methods including the mobile app and paper QR tickets remain in development, due in 2022.  The client has since returned to the lab to conduct further user research into possible future ticket readers.
