# User testing a public transport ticket reader #

Client: Cubic

## Overview ##

New York City’s transport system operates using a system of plastic cards that passengers load with funds and then swipe through ticket barriers. Rolled out in 1993, the transit authority wanted to bring their ticket readers up to date so they accepted new payment methods such as contactless.

## Challenge ##

Our client Cubic was designing a machine that would recognise and accept payments via contactless, digital tickets within a mobile app and machine-printed paper tickets containing QR codes. To prevent congestion during peak times, 30 passengers needed to pass through the gates per minute. User testing conducted in San Diego several weeks before had found that users took up to a minute to validate their ticket and open the gate barriers: it was not clear to users where the machine’s scanner was located. To avoid a re-design of the physical device and potential delay to the roll-out, the client wanted to understand whether changes to the reader display could fix the problem. 

## My role ##

I worked as UX consultant within City’s Interaction Lab, a commercial UX consultancy operating within City’s Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design. I met with the client to learn more about the ticket barriers and understand what they expected to achieve from the study. I designed the study, created all test materials, managed a student consultant and produced a detailed report for the client.
 
## Approach ##

### Preparation ###

The study involved multiple variables and scenarios. New York’s transport system includes buses and trains and client had an old subway validator we could test as a benchmark. The new machines were going to work with 3 types of tickets – 2 paper versions and 1 within a mobile phone app. [images] Lastly, the client had produced 4 different images to be used within machine display.

I put together a script that tested each of the validators with different combinations of tickets and displays. Because participants could learn the system and to reduce bias associated with the first and last ticket readers they tried, I varied the task order. I created a separate spreadsheet to use during testing so we keep track of type of machine, display and ticket for each task and session. [spreadsheet] A mix of commuter and visitor participants were recruited via an external agency.

### Study ###

We piloted the study in the client’s office and noticed we needed a definitive way of measuring time on task. In the lab we marked the floor with masking tape. [image] Then after I give the participant the first task we started the timer. Once the participant  passed through the ticket barrier and walked into the taped zone, we stopped the timer.

Within the usability lab we set up the 3 different validators – bus, subway and existing subway machine. We used 2 cameras to record participants as they used the machines. The ticket validators were initially covered by boxes, so participants’ initial impressions were captured while the cameras were recording. 

Participants successfully validated their ticket when the screen displayed a static QR code towards the bottom of the device, closest to the scanner. Using this finding, the client was able to test 2 new iterations of the QR-code display on the second day of testing.  
 
### Findings and recommendations ###

After finishing the testing I reviewed the session notes together with the student consultant and agreed on the main findings. 

Of all the different screens tested, participants were more likely to validate their ticket with one displaying a QR-code in the lower half of the device. The placement and range of the scanner meant users needed to hover their ticket a few centimeters above the lower edge of the device. Even with the best performing variation of the display, participants struggled to learn where exactly they needed to position their ticket in order to pass through the barriers. Many couldn’t do this within 2 seconds, especially on their first attempt.

The main high-level recommendation following the study was:

1.	If time permits, update the physical device. Recess and inset the scanner so users can successfully validate their ticket by placing it directly on the screen. The tactile feedback would provide users with certainty and confidence, and would make learning where to place the ticket easy. 
2.	If time doesn’t allow,change the display so users are more likely to position their ticket within the scanner’s range. Possible changes to consider and test include:
   * Dividing the contactless and barcode sections of the screen with different background colours to prevent users from placing mobile and paper tickets directly on the display. 
   * Updating the static image to an animation that shows a hand holding a QR code ticket in the correct position in front of the device. 
   * Adding decals and labels to the device housing to direct users towards the scanner.
   
My written report provided additional detailed findings and recommendations for the ticket barrier –its height, lights, and sounds; the device housing; the display; and planned turnstiles. While there weren’t enough participants to produce statistically representative results, we also provided time on task for each participant.

## Outcome ##
The New York Transit Authority started rolling out the first phase of new ticket readers in 2019. To start these have been limited to contactless, Apple Pay and Google Pay while the mobile app and paper QR tickets remain in development.  The client has since returned to the lab to conduct further user research into possible future ticket readers.
